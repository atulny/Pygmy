Project Euler in Pygmy
===

The purpose of this page is to demonstrate how things can be done in Pygmy by solving some [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems.

Problem 1
---

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

    alert|
      [1 999].fill
        .filter*[(x){ x % 3 = 0 || x % 5 = 0 }]
        .sum



Problem 2
---

> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    fibs:: (list) {
      next:: list.-1 + list.-2
      next < 4000000 => fibs| list & next
      list
    }

    alert|
      fibs*[[1 2]]
       .filter*[(x){ x % 2 = 0 }]
       .sum

Problem 4
---

> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 99.

> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

    isPalindrome:: (n) {
      n.toString = n.toString.reverse
    }

    alert| 
	  [900 999].fill
	    .multiply*[[900 999].fill (a b){a * b}]
		.filter*[(n){ n \isPalindrome }]
		.max


Problem 5
---

> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

    gcd:: (x y) {
      y = 0 => x
      gcd| y, (x % y)
    }

    lcm:: (x y) {
      x * y / gcd| x, y
    }

    alert| [1 20].fill.reduce| lcm

Problem 6
---

> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

> 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025

>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

    square:: (x) { x * x }

    sumOfSquares:: [1 100].fill.map*[square].sum
    squareOfSum:: [1 100].fill.sum \square

    alert| squareOfSum - sumOfSquares
